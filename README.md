gMusic
======

I love music, I really do, which is just as well seeing as I'm tone deaf. [#1 son makes and produces music](https://soundcloud.com/btrax-official-uk) and some of it is really to my taste (very little not TBH) so along with [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) I've tried most of the online music services going. [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/) was lovely but I found [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/uk/) a wee bit intrusive... then [Google Music](https://play.google.com/music/) came along and I was in heaven. A wee few squid a month means I get to listen to nigh on anything that takes my fancy... and I do do so... all day long! As well as all the music I've been collecting since my adolescence. Coding with music should really be [obligatory](http://musicforprogramming.net/)!

Thing is though, I do need to talk to other people sometimes and I end up losing the Google Music tab while I'm away with the music fairies. I end up getting reminded that there's a meeting or a scrum that I need to attend and whilst I can always go without pausing the music I find that my headphones (without my head between the speakers to muffle the sound) tend to distract others with that there tinny noise! Thus I decided to spend a few days of my annual leave creating a remote control in the form of a Chrome Extension. It should just display a play/pause icon that, when clicked, plays or pauses the music I'm listening to.

It seems to work for me but I reckon that the whole spirit of opensource should mean that if anyone else can see an improvement then I should embrace it - thus it's hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/annoyingmouse/gMusic). Please do take it and play, but please do help others by sending your enhancements back.

Added to the [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmusic/aiceljnooekdohpfkopeaojkkgebolli), as an [Opera Extensions](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/gmusic/) and currently being reviewed as an Edge Extension.

Altered it to work with [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/g_music/) - FireFox folder.
