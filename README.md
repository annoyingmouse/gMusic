I love music, I really do, which is just as well seeing as I'm tone deaf. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/btrax-official-uk">#1 son makes and produces music</a> and some of it is really to my taste (very little not TBH) so along with <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a> I've tried most of the online music services going. <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> was lovely but I found <a href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/">Spotify</a> a wee bit intrusive... then <a href="https://play.google.com/music/">Google Music</a> came along and I was in heaven. A wee few squid a month means I get to listen to nigh on anything that takes my fancy... and I do do so... all day long! As well as all the music I've been collecting since my adolescence. Coding with music should really be <a href="http://musicforprogramming.net/">obligatory</a>!

Thing is though, I do need to talk to other people sometimes and I end up losing the Google Music tab while I'm away with the music fairies. I end up getting reminded that there's a meeting or a scrum that I need to attend and whilst I can always go without pausing the music I find that my headphones (without my head between the speakers to muffle the sound) tend to distract others with that there tinny noise! Thus I decided to spend a few days of my annual leave creating a remote control in the form of a Chrome Extension. It should just display a play/pause icon that, when clicked, plays or pauses the music I'm listening to.

It seems to work for me but I reckon that the whole spirit of opensource should mean that if anyone else can see an improvement then I should embrace it - thus it's hosted on <a href="https://github.com/annoyingmouse/gMusic">GitHub</a>. Please do take it and play, but please do help others by sending your enhancements back.

Eventually I'll work up the bottle to submit it to the Chrome Store but I think I need to do a wee bit more research along the way yet.
